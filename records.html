                <td><p>Why do I get certified?</p><br>
                    <p>First of all, we must remember that learning is a process and you should do everything that is possible to make this process easy, uninterrupted and systematic. When you prepare for a certification exam, you do it much better and more intense. A certification exam has a vital positive influence on your educational process. Secondly, having a certificate makes your position on the labor market much stronger. The certificates act as an indicator of expertise and excellent leverage while seeking promotions. The certificates depict about the knowledge and skills of the students to the employers and raise the confidence levels of the learners to perform a specific job. The Certificates along with their associated preparation activities, are a great way to sharpen the existing skills and take the learners to the next level. In addition, many students utilize the certificates as a reskill tool to expand potential career paths on today's ever-shifting economic landscape. Your skills are as important as your experience. If you are a beginning programmer with no experience, you have to show your skills. A certificate is most suitable for this purpose. If you already have a job in the industry – things are straight away easier for you.</p>

                <ol>
                  <li>Use all of the time allowed for the entire exam.</li>
